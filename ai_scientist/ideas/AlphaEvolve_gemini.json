        "Title": "\"Why is it O(n^2)?\": Large Language Models as Socratic Tutors for Algorithmic Complexity",
        "Short Hypothesis": "An LLM, guided by a Socratic prompting framework, can effectively tutor users in understanding the time and space complexity of code snippets by engaging them in an interactive dialogue that encourages critical thinking and step-by-step reasoning, leading to better learning outcomes than static explanations. This specific direction is crucial because true comprehension of algorithmic complexity, especially for novices, arises from active reasoning rather than passive reception of facts. An interactive Socratic dialogue with an LLM provides a unique, scalable, and adaptable environment for this guided reasoning, which simpler methods like static analysis tools (providing only the 'what') or non-interactive explanations fail to achieve.",
        "Related Work": "Current research on LLMs and code primarily focuses on tasks like complexity *identification* (e.g., TASTY, CodeComplex by Agarwal et al., 2023) or generating *static* code explanations (e.g., work by MacNeil et al. on explanation variations, or Zhang et al. on faithful explanations). While some works explore LLMs in education or for general code understanding (e.g., \"Chain of Understanding\" by Yuan et al. for hierarchical comprehension), a dedicated approach using LLMs as *interactive Socratic tutors* specifically for algorithmic complexity is novel. Existing tools might provide the 'what' (the complexity class) or a one-shot 'why', but our proposal investigates the 'how to reason' through a guided, conversational process, which is distinct from merely retrieving or generating an answer. This pedagogical interaction for a nuanced topic like complexity remains largely unexplored.",
        "Abstract": "Understanding the time and space complexity of algorithms is fundamental in computer science, yet often challenging for learners. Current tools and Large Language Models (LLMs) typically provide direct answers or static explanations about code complexity. We propose a novel approach: leveraging LLMs as Socratic tutors to guide users interactively towards an understanding of *why* a piece of code exhibits a certain complexity. Our system will engage the user in a dialogue, prompting them to analyze code constructs (loops, recursion), trace execution paths, and identify dominant operations, rather than simply providing the complexity class. We hypothesize that this interactive, Socratic method will foster deeper conceptual understanding and critical thinking skills compared to passive reception of information. This research will involve developing a Socratic prompting framework for LLMs and conducting user studies to evaluate learning gains and user experience against traditional explanation methods. This work aims to pave the way for more effective, AI-driven pedagogical tools in programming education.",

        "Short Hypothesis": "An evolutionary algorithm that simultaneously evolves both the code solutions and the LLM prompting strategies used to generate those solutions will discover higher-quality and more diverse algorithms than systems using fixed or non-adaptive prompting. This is crucial because the optimal way to instruct an LLM to generate or mutate code likely changes as the evolutionary search explores different regions of the solution space; co-evolution allows prompts to adapt dynamically to the current evolutionary context, a capability that simpler, static prompt optimization methods lack.",
        "Related Work": "This proposal builds upon ideas like AlphaEvolve (the user-provided inspiration), which uses LLMs in an evolutionary loop for code synthesis. However, AlphaEvolve's description implies a potentially fixed or pre-defined 'Prompt Sampler.' MetaPromptEvolve distinguishes itself by making the *prompt itself* a primary, adaptive component of the evolutionary process, co-evolving alongside the code. It differs from Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) methods (e.g., Zhou et al., 2022; Fernando et al., 2023 'Promptbreeder') which optimize prompts for static tasks or single generations; MetaPromptEvolve integrates prompt evolution *within* the ongoing code evolution, allowing prompts to specialize and adapt over many generations. While systems like FunSearch or AlphaDev use LLMs for code proposals in evolutionary search, the explicit focus on evolving the *instructional language* (the prompts) given to the LLM as a core adaptive mechanism is novel. Research on Quality-Diversity with LLMs (e.g., Lim et al., 2024) is related in its aim for diverse, quality solutions, but MetaPromptEvolve specifically investigates evolving a diverse set of *effective prompts* as a means to achieve diverse and effective code.",
        "Abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in generating code, but harnessing their full potential for algorithmic discovery often requires sophisticated prompting. Current approaches typically rely on fixed, hand-crafted prompts or pre-optimized prompt strategies. We propose MetaPromptEvolve, a system where the LLM prompting strategies *co-evolve* with the programmatic solutions themselves within an evolutionary computation framework. In MetaPromptEvolve, a population of prompts is maintained and evolved alongside a population of code solutions. The fitness of a prompt is determined by its ability to guide an LLM (e.g., Gemini) to generate high-quality, novel, or diverse code variants that contribute to the evolutionary search. This dual evolution allows prompting strategies to dynamically adapt to the changing landscape of the solution space, potentially unlocking more effective exploration and exploitation than static prompting. We hypothesize that MetaPromptEvolve will lead to the discovery of superior algorithms and a more diverse set of solutions compared to evolutionary systems using fixed prompts. Experiments will focus on evolving solutions for combinatorial optimization problems and analyzing the trajectory and characteristics of the co-evolved prompts.",

This direction is crucial because while LLMs can generate working code, its adoption is hindered by poor maintainability; an evolutionary approach that directly optimizes for these human-centric factors offers a scalable way to iteratively refine code quality beyond what simple prompting or static analysis alone can achieve.",
        "Related Work": "The inspiration, AlphaEvolve, focuses on algorithmic discovery emphasizing performance and correctness. Our work differs by making readability and maintainability first-class optimization objectives within the evolutionary fitness function. Recent studies like \"Better Python Programming for all: With the focus on Maintainability\" (arXiv:2408.08387) highlight the need for maintainable LLM-generated code and explore methods like specific dataset usage, but typically don't employ an evolutionary framework where maintainability metrics directly guide code generation and selection. Other works on LLMs and code evolution (e.g., \"Code Evolution Graphs\", arXiv:2503.16668; \"EvoPrompting\", Chen et al. 2023) explore LLMs as mutation operators or for NAS, but do not specifically target the evolution of human-centric code qualities like readability as a primary, quantified objective. Existing systems for improving code quality via LLMs often rely on one-shot prompting or post-processing, whereas our approach uses continuous evolutionary pressure based on quantified metrics.",
        "Abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating functionally correct code, the resulting programs often lack the readability, maintainability, and stylistic consistency prized in software engineering. This hinders their practical adoption and long-term value. We propose an evolutionary framework, 'EvoReadableCode,' that leverages LLMs to generate and refine code with a primary focus on human-centric qualities. Our system employs an evolutionary algorithm where the fitness function explicitly incorporates automated metrics for code readability (e.g., cyclomatic complexity, comment density, style adherence) and maintainability, alongside functional correctness and performance. An LLM (e.g., Gemini) acts as the mutation engine, proposing code modifications. Through iterative selection based on this multi-objective fitness, we hypothesize that EvoReadableCode will generate solutions that are not only correct and efficient but also significantly more understandable and easier to maintain by human developers compared to code produced by LLMs with standard prompts or systems optimizing solely for performance. This research aims to bridge the gap between automated code generation and the practical demands of software development by evolving code that humans can readily adopt and build upon.",
